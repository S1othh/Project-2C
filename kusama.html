        <p class="description">
            Utilizing repeating patterns, particularly polka dots, which evoke a sensation of infinity, is one of Kusama's most recognizable motifs. In addition to producing an aesthetic, the repetition relates to her own experiences of loneliness and mental health issues, providing a therapeutic outlet through the creative process. Kusama's distinctive polka dots are easily identifiable and have grown to be an essential component of her artistic persona. Simple forms like bright red dots on yellow or black dots on white backgrounds are used to great effect. There is a conflict between order and chaos because of the motif's simplicity and endless recurrence. Mirrors in her Infinity Rooms intensify this feeling of repetition, adding to the sensation of infinity and immersing the observer in a sensory experience.
