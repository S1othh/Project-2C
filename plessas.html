        <p class="description">
            Greek multidisciplinary artist Angelo Plessas works at the nexus of philosophy, online culture, and art. He is renowned for using the internet as a canvas that combines identification, symbolism, and interactivity. Typography is often used as a dynamic, reactive, symbolic element in his web-based works.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title2">What</h2>
        <p class="description">
            In Plessas's work, generative and interactive typography appears as web pages that are artworks in which the typographic elements alter in response to human input (clicking, dragging, and hovering). Additionally, he employs dynamic type for spiritual words, sigils, and customized scripts. Additionally, he uses custom type motions that serve as a visual rhythm and a means of communication.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title2">How</h2>
        <p class="description">
            Plessas uses HTML/CSS/JavaScript for interactivity.
        </p>
        <h2 class="title2">Reflection</h2>
        <p class="description">
            He reinterprets writing as ritualistic and symbolic in addition to factual. Users become actors in a digital ritual as a result of the viewer's engagement activating the text.
