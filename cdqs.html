            Created for the GDQS Country Story Book by Intake, this six-piece data art collection turns Global Diet Quality Score (GDQS) data from more than 80,000 people in 23 countries into colorful visualizations. The 25 GDQS food groups are represented by unique visual components in each piece of art, such as bright red circles for "Red Meat" and wavy white lines for "Whole Grains," which signify dietary patterns. Individuals' dietary information is represented by the centerpiece as vibrant rings, with each section's size and color representing the range and amount of foods ingested in a given day. Additional components, each inspired by well-known shapes like lollipops or fruit slices, tackle distinct themes such as animal source foods, vegetables and tubers, sweets and processed meals, whole foods, and fruits. This collection, which offers a visually captivating narrative of dietary statistics and its influence, celebrates the richness, diversity, and cultural nuances of global diets, drawing inspiration from universal experiences such as shared meals.
